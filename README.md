General Assembly SEI Project 1: **Spanish Flashcards**
___
## Welcome

This project is a flashcard game intended to help those learning Spanish vocabulary.  It was developed by Brian Mays, a student in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program.

## About

Spanish Flashcards was built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  It is more of a traditional flashcard teaching tool than a "game," in that there is no limit to the number of cards a student can guess, and the score is simply to keep track of learning progress.  The player/student starts a new game, and the program shuffles the deck.  The player clicks on the flashcards to see the Spanish word or phrase, and then once they've made a guess, they click on it again to "turn the card over" and see the matching English word or phrase.  If they guessed correctly, they click "Right," and the score goes up one.  If not, they can click "Wrong."  Either way, the player can then click on the flashcard again for the next card to appear.

The game can be played on its [GitHub Page](https://eskatonic.github.io/flashcards/), or by forking and cloning the [repository](https://github.com/eskatonic/flashcards).
